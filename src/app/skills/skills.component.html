            In addition to the above experience I am continuously tinkering and trying new frameworks
            and libraries for both front and back-end development. Often I will read an article on Medium.com or
            HackerNoon and try out a project in subjects such as authorisation, UI libraries, data storage, optimised
            performance, etc.
